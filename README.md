# M5Stack-Helium-Mapper

## Description of Project

This is a [M5Stack](https://m5stack.com) [UIFlow](https://flow.m5stack.com) used to connect to any available [Helium LoRaWAN gateway](https://helium.com) and send location information to [Helium Cargo Integration](https://cargo.helium.com/).  Using UIFlow, you can also generate the necessary Micro Python code to utilize this capability outside of UIFlow.

## Required Hardware

Please note:  If you are a US resident, Digikey carries MOST of these devices.  You really should try there first as shipping directly from M5Stack is either expensive or takes a while.
